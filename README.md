# Hi, I'm Ryan.

I write average code for average purposes.

I also <a href="https://soundcloud.com/friendzzchan">make music and stuff</a>.

Here are some cool projects I've made.

## <a href=https://www.github.com/letsbefriendzz/Java-RayCasting/>3D Ray Caster</a> in Java

Currently a heavy work in progress, this project seeks to build a 3D ray caster from the ground up. From my own vector and matrix classes to ray generation, I'm trying to make this entire project with exclusively my own code. 

## <a href="https://www.github.com/letsbefriendzz/pycolours">Colour Format Conversion</a> in Python

I like math. I like colours. I wanted to explore how they're manipulated digitally.

In this program I implemented various RGB / HSV conversion algorithms, and tested using OpenCV.

## <a href="https://www.github.com/letsbefriendzz/LCBOscraper/">LCBO Web Scraper</a> in Python

In an attempt to discover the most cost efficient alcohol in the province of Ontario, I wrote a webscraper using the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` Python libraries to help me gather all 14,000+ LCBO listings and their metadata.

## <a href="https://www.github.com/letsbefriendzz/Python2D/">2D Image & GIF Rendering</a> using Python & OpenCV

Draws coordinate shapes in 2D using my own methods and classes. OpenCV is used to bounce the animations to GIF or static image formats.
