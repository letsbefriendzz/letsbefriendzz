# Hi, I'm Ryan.

I write average code for average purposes.

I also <a href="https://soundcloud.com/friendzzchan">make music and stuff</a>.

Here are some cool projects I've made.

## LCBO Web Scraper in Python

In an attempt to discover the most cost efficient alcohol in the province of Ontario, I wrote a webscraper using the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` Python libraries to help me gather all 14,000+ LCBO listings and their metadata.

## Colour Format Conversion in Python

I like math. I like colours. I wanted to explore how they're manipulated digitally.

In <a href="https://www.github.com/letsbefriendzz/pycolours">this program</a> I implemented various RGB / HSV conversion algorithms, and tested using OpenCV.
